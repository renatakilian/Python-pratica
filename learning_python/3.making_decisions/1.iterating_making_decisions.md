# Iterating and making decisions

In order to control the flow of a program, we have two main weapon: **conditional programming** (also known as **branching**) and **looping**. We can use them in many different combinations and variations.

## Conditional programming
Conditional programming, or branching, is something you do every day, every moment. It  s about evaluating conditions: __if the light is green, then I can cross__; __if it's raining, then I'm taking an umbrella__; and __if I'm late for work, then I'll call my manager__.
The main tool is the ```if``` statement, which comes in different forms and colors, but basically what it does is evaluate an expression and, based on the result, choose which part of the code to execute.

Example: (also see cond1.py file)

```
late = True
if late:
    print('I need to call my manager!')
```

```late``` acts as a conditional expression, which is evaluated in a Boolean context (exactly life if we're calling ```bool(late)```). If the result of the evaluation is **True**, then we enter the body of code immediately after the ```if``` statement. Notice that the ```print``` instruction is indented: this means it belongs to a scope defined by the ```if``` clause. Execution of this code yields:

```
$ python cond1.py
I need to call my manager!
```

Since ```late``` is ```True```, the ```print``` statement was executed.
