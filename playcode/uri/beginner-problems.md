## 1001 - Extremely basic

Read 2 integer values and store them in variables, named A and B and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable X. Print X as shown below. Don't present any message beyond what is being specified and don't forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.

**Input**

The input file contain 2 integer values.

**Output**

Print the variable X according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal. 'X' is uppercase and you have to print a blank space before and after the '=' signal.

| Input Sample | Input Sample | Output Samples |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |

|-30           | 10           | PROD = -300    |
| 0            | 9            | PROD = 0       |


## 1005 - Average 1

Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point. Don’t forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”. Don’t forget the space before and after the equal sign.

**Input**

The input file contains 2 floating points' values with one digit after the decimal point.

**Output**

Print MEDIA(average in Portuguese) according to the following example, with 5 digits after the decimal point and with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
